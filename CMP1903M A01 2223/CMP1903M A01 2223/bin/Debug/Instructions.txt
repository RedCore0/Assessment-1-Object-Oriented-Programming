Instructions
To start the maths tutor choose how many cards it should deal.
If for example you chose to deal 3 cards following will happen:
	First card's value will represent first number in the equation.
	Second card's suit will represent the operator, e.g. + or -.
	Third card's value will represent the second number in the equation.
You will then have to calculate the sum of those numbers round it to 0 decimal points
and type it in.
